# Blood-Connect

## Introduction

The **Blood Connect Application** is a powerful mobile application built using Flutter, designed to connect blood donors with blood banks through the use of bipartite maximal matching algorithms. This application aims to streamline the process of matching blood donors with blood banks efficiently, ensuring a quick and reliable supply of blood for patients in need.

## Features

### 1. Bipartite Maximal Matching

- The core functionality of the application is to perform bipartite maximal matching between blood donors and blood banks.
- The algorithm ensures that as many donors as possible are connected to compatible blood banks, optimizing the availability of blood for those in need.

### 2. User Registration

- Donors and blood banks can register their profiles on the mobile app.
- Donors provide details such as their blood type, contact information, and availability.
- Blood banks provide information about their location, contact details, and the types of blood they require.

### 3. Matching Algorithm

- The application uses a sophisticated matching algorithm to connect donors with the most suitable blood banks.
- Compatibility factors, such as blood type and location, are taken into account to maximize the chances of a successful match.

### 4. Real-time Notifications

- Donors and blood banks receive real-time notifications when a successful match is found.
- Notifications include details about the recipient and the location for blood donation.

### 5. Donation Scheduling

- Donors can schedule blood donation appointments at their convenience.
- Blood banks can manage their appointment slots and coordinate with donors efficiently.

### 6. Review and Feedback

- Users can provide feedback and rate their experiences, ensuring continuous improvement of the platform.
- Reviews and ratings help other users make informed decisions.
